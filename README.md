This is the public repository used to maintain the Red Hat Customer Success handbook.

Currently, this space is being used as a github experiment, to determine if is an appropriate tool for visible, change-logged, asynchronous collaboration on fundamental team agreements like our vision and mission.

Other tools under evaluation include the [Open Decision Hub framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/blob/master/ODF-community.pdf).
